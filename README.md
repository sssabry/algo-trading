This is a running repository in which I'm pushing various algorithmic trading strategies I've explored. 
My main focus has been to analyze different standard strategies, and their potential integrations with Machine Learning models like Random Forest, 
and the impact this then has on their effectivity and accuracy.

This is a continuous project, mainly documenting my own exploriations 

(Note: not yet fully updated, I've just started pushing files from various explorations I've done in the past!)
